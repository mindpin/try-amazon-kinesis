This guide is intended as a reference for those working with Maven for the first time
but is also intended to serve as a cookbook with self-contained references and solutions for common use cases
For first time users
it is recommended that you step through the material in a sequential fashion
For users more familiar with Maven
this guide endeavours to provide a quick solution for the need at hand
It is assumed at this point that you have downloaded Maven and installed Maven on your local machine
